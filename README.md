GMW (Get the Monkey Works)
===

It's not the idea of this project to develop a tool to manage other people to do your tasks. The monkey is you!!!

The goal of this project is to manage our own tasks using a mix of methodologies:
* GTD (Get Things Done) to plan your activities in a week long time.
* Pomodoro to work on a daily basis.
